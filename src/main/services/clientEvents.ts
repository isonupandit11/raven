/**
 * Server-attributed product events from the Electron client.
 *
 * Send-side counterpart of the Pro backend's POST /api/events
 * route. Distinct from src/main/analytics.ts:
 *   - analytics.ts ships ANONYMOUS events to PostHog with a
 *     random distinctId. Aggregate insights, opt-out-able. Privacy
 *     contract is "telemetry is anonymous".
 *   - THIS module ships USER-ATTRIBUTED events to our managed
 *     backend (only in Pro mode, only when authenticated). Powers
 *     the admin dashboard's per-user health view. Privacy contract
 *     is "the same cloud-sync trust bucket as sessions and modes
 *     (which we already disclose for Pro accounts)".
 *
 * Behavior:
 *   - trackEvent() always buffers, regardless of isProMode() at
 *     call time. The actual gate on whether anything leaves the
 *     device is at flush time, via isAuthenticated() from the
 *     authService, AND via initClientEvents not starting a flush
 *     timer in OSS mode.  Earlier versions had a synchronous
 *     isProMode() check inside trackEvent() that silently dropped
 *     events fired from the renderer during the brief window
 *     between renderer-side auth ready and main-process pro-mode
 *     flag propagation - which manifested as missing
 *     `onboarding_started` events for fresh signups (Bug
 *     triaged 2026-06-03; see admin dashboard activity feed
 *     for s1090404300@gmail.com vs xcn04248@gmail.com).
 *   - OSS mode: events buffer in memory but never leave the
 *     device (initClientEvents() returns early before setting
 *     the flush timer, so flush() is never invoked; the buffer's
 *     MAX_BUFFER cap means the in-memory footprint is bounded
 *     at ~40KB).
 *   - Pro + authenticated: events buffered, flushed every
 *     FLUSH_INTERVAL_MS or when buffer reaches FLUSH_AT. POST
 *     /api/events with the buffer; on any failure (network, 5xx)
 *     we discard the batch rather than retry. Events are "best
 *     effort" - losing one to a network blip is acceptable; the
 *     source of truth for whether something happened is the side
 *     effect (a session row, a Sentry error), not the event.
 *   - Pro + temporarily unauthenticated (e.g., tokens being
 *     refreshed): flush() detects this and prepends the batch
 *     back to the buffer for the next flush attempt rather than
 *     dropping it.
 *   - Buffer has a hard cap (MAX_BUFFER) so a long offline window
 *     can't grow memory unbounded. Oldest events are dropped first
 *     (FIFO) so the most recent state is preserved.
 *
 * NOT sent: PII content, transcript text, AI prompts, file names,
 * credentials. Backend also strips PII-shaped metadata keys at
 * write time (defense in depth).
